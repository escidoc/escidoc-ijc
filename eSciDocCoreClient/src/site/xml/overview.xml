		The eSciDoc Infrastructure Java Client Library (short:
		client-lib) shall
		smooth the way for Java programmer to implement
		application on top of
		the eSciDoc Infrastructure.  
	</para>

	<para>Each version of the eSciDoc Infrastructure Java Client Library
		supports a specific version of the eSciDoc Infrastructure. The
		supported version of the infrastructure is shown within the package
		name.
	</para>
	<para> This version of the client lib supports only eSciDoc
		Infrastructures in version 1.2[.x]. The compatibility with
		update
		versions of the 1.2 series should be given. 
	</para>
	<para>A client lib for version 1.2 is definitely not compatible with
		eSciDoc Infrastructure
		version 1.0 or 1.1.
	</para>
	<para>
		The infrastructure delivers XML representation to support
		programming language independent client applications.
		Programming with
		Java means usually to work with classes. This client lib could hide
		all
		required steps of mapping between XML representation and classes.
		Who does not need the mapping feature can still benefit from the
		method stubs and the hidden transport.  
	</para>
	<para>The client lib contains only little logic and does therefore give
		only little support to compile required values. Parameter and data
		structure checking is done by the infrastructure to avoid a
		duplication of logic. Nevertheless, make it POJOs easier to explore
		settable values.
