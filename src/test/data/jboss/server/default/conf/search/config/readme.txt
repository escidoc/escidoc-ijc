This directory and the subdirectories contain the configuration for the eSciDoc-Core Search and Indexing.
NOTE: The index escidocoaipmh_all is used internally by the eSciDoc-Core-Infrastructure and may not get deleted!!

Indexing:
-Done internally by the eSciDoc-Core-Infrastructure

-Is triggered whenever an escidoc-object changes (create, update, delete).

-Needs one overall configuration-file named fedoragsearch.properties which is located in this directory.
    -In fedoragsearch.properties, state the names of the indexes that should be written 
     separated with whitespace as property with name fedoragsearch.indexNames.
    -For each index create a subdirectory ./index/<indexname> for the search + indexing configuration of this index.
    -Indexes that are not stated in the fedoragsearch.properties are not written, even if a configuration-directory exists.
    -Following properties can be set in fedoragsearch.properties:
        -fedoragsearch.indexNames: names of the indexes, whitespace-separated
        -fedoragsearch.pdfTextExtractorCommand:
         if pdfBox (internally used by gsearch to extract text from pdfs) is not working well for your pdfs,
         define command-line-command to custom pdf-text-extractor (has to get installed seperately)
        -fedoragsearch.ignoreTextExtractionErrors
         true|false Defines what happenes if an Exception occurs while extracting the text from an pdf for indexing
         if set to true, Exception is ignored and object is indexed without the fulltext.
         if set to false, Exception is thrown and object is not indexed at all.
        -fedoragsearch.soapBase
         points to the host where the fedoragsearch runs. 
         Change it if fedoragsearch runs on a different machine as eSciDocCore-Framework.

-For each index a subdirectory ./index/<indexname>, containing the configuration-files is needed

-Configuration-files for one index used by fedoragsearch are:
 (Please copy files from an existing index-configuration and modify)
    -indexInfo.xml, containing basic information about the index
    -index.properties, containing properties for the index
        -Properties are:
            -fgsindex.indexName: name of the index, according to name stated in fedoragsearch.properties
            -fgsindex.defaultUpdateIndexDocXslt: Name of the stylesheet used to 
             transform the escidoc-object-xml into the index-information-document. (see below)
             NOTE: stylesheet-file has to end with .xslt, property is name of the file without .xslt !!!
             Alternatively an URL to the stylesheet can be used. 
             Then you dont need to put a stylesheet in the config-directory.
            -fgsindex.indexDir: Directory where the index-files should get written.
             Specify absolute path.
            -fgsindex.analyzer: The Analyzer to use for indexing 
             (normally please use de.escidoc.sb.common.lucene.analyzer.EscidocAnalyzer)
    
    -index.object-types.properties:
        Holds properties to configure which types of eSciDoc-Objects should get indexed 
         or deleted from the index under which conditions:
         
            Example: If eSciDoc-items should get written into the index, 
            your properties for the item-indexing should start with the prefix Resource.Item.
            
            Object-Types that can get indexed are:
                -Item
                -Container
                -Context
                -OrganizationalUnit
                -ContentModel
                -ContentRelation
                
            For each Object-Type that shall get indexed in this index you can define 
            the following properties:                
            1. Define if indexing should be done synchronously or asynchronously
                Resource.<objecttype>.indexAsynchronous=true|false
            2. Optionally define a property Resource.<objecttype>.indexingPrerequisiteXpath
               if you only want to index the item if it meets some conditions.
               This property expects an XPath-Expression
            3. Optionally define a property Resource.<objecttype>.deletePrerequisiteXpath
               if you want to delete the object from the index when it meets some conditions.
               This property expects an XPath-Expression
            4. Optionally define a property Resource.<objecttype>.indexReleasedVersion=true or =both
               Set value to true:
               if you only want to index the last released version of an object.
               If this option is set, always the last released version of an object is indexed.
               If no last released version exists, nothing is indexed.
               Set value to both:
               if you want to index the last released version of an object additionally to the last version of an object.
               If this option is set, always the last released version and the last version of an object is indexed.
               If no last released version exists, only the last version is indexed.
               NOTE: if value is both you have to set the property cqlTranslator.filterLatestRelease in the srw-properties file to true!!
            5. Optionally for resource Item, you can define a property Resource.Item.indexFulltextVisibilities
               where you can define fulltexts of which visibility shall get indexed. (whitespace-separated)
               eg Resource.Item.indexFulltextVisibilities=private audience public
               This is just a variable with name INDEX_FULLTEXT_VISIBILITIES that gets passed to the indexing-stylesheet.
               So you have to handle fulltext-indexing dependent on this variable in your indexing-stylesheet.
   
            You can define properties for more than one objectType in one configuration-file.

    -eventually a stylesheet that is used by fedoragsearch 
     to transform the escidoc-object-xml into the index-information-document.
     For more doku about this stylesheet, please refer to the Documentation of the eSciDoc Search and Browse Component.
     

Search:
-Needs one overall configuration-file named SRWServer.props which is located in this directory.
    -In SRWServer.props, for each index that is searchable, state the search-interface to use
     and the path to the configuration-file. 
     
     Path to the configuration should be index/<indexname>/<config-file-name>
     so the index-configuration and the search-configuration files for one index are located in one Directory.
     
     Poperty-names must contain the name of the index, 
     eg db.escidoc_all.configuration, where escidoc_all is the indexname.
     
     The search-interface (property db.<indexname>.class) always must be de.escidoc.sb.srw.EscidocSRWDatabaseImpl !!

-For each index, needs a configuration-file with name + path as stated in the SRWServer.props.

-Configuration-file for one index must contain the following properties:
    -databaseInfo.title, databaseInfo.description, databaseInfo.contact:
     descriptive information about the database

    -cqlTranslator.indexPath:
     Path to the index: 
     Must match property fgsindex.indexDir defined in index.properties!

    -cqlTranslator.identifierTerm:
     Stored field in the index that is used for display.

    -numberOfRecords:
     default number of records to return per page. 

    -maximumRecords:
     highest possible maximum of records to retrun per page. 
     this overwrites the maximum that was given in request if it is above maximumRecords

    -cqlTranslator.defaultIndexField:
     default Index field to search if no field is provided in search. 

    -cqlTranslator.analyzer:
     Analyzer to use for search. 
     this must be the same Analyzer as used for indexing!

-Configuration-file for one index may contain the following properties:
    -cqlTranslator.forceScoring:
     Flag indicating if scoring has to get forced even for wildcard query or range query. 
     slows down the search if set to true

    -cqlTranslator.permissionFiltering:
     Flag indicating if query has to get expanded by a permission filterQuery
     because the index contains objects not everybody may see. 

    -cqlTranslator.filterLatestRelease:
     Flag indicating if index contains both latestReleased version and latestVersion of an Object.
     If so, we have to filter duplicates.
     this only works if database contains the following indexes for each document:
     -rootPid: Field containing the rootPid of the object, without version-identifier
     -type: Field containing the type (0: latestVersion, 1:latestRelease)
     NOTE: Also set the property indexReleasedVersion in the file index.object-types.properties
     to index both latestReleased version and latestVersion of an Object.

-Configuration-file for one index can contain configuration for a Highlighter:
    -cqlTranslator.highlighterClass
     must be set to de.escidoc.sb.srw.lucene.highlighting.EscidocHighlighter
     otherwise no highlighting is done

    -cqlTranslator.highlightXmlizerClass
     2 predefined Xmlizers available: 
     (if property is not set, de.escidoc.sb.srw.lucene.highlighting.EscidocSimpleHighlightXmlizer is used)
        -de.escidoc.sb.srw.lucene.highlighting.EscidocHighlightXmlizer
            -generates one xml-snippet per text-fragment with: 
             text to highlight + extra section containing positions of highlight-terms within the text.
        -de.escidoc.sb.srw.lucene.highlighting.EscidocSimpleHighlightXmlizer
            -generates one xml-snippet with text to highlight, 
             containing all text-fragments, including tags around terms to highlight (eg <B>)

    -cqlTranslator.highlightFragmentSize, default: 100
     length of one text-fragment containing terms to highlight

    -cqlTranslator.highlightMaxFragments, default: 4
     maximum number of text-fragments containing highlight-terms to display

    -cqlTranslator.highlightFragmentSeparator, default: <escidoc-fragment-separator>
     separator between 2 text-fragments

    -cqlTranslator.highlightStartMarker, default:<escidoc-highlight-start>
     used by EscidocSimpleHighlightXmlizer, tag that is set before start of term to highlight (eg <B>)

    -cqlTranslator.highlightEndMarker, default:<escidoc-highlight-end>
     used by EscidocSimpleHighlightXmlizer, tag that is set after end of term to highlight (eg </B>)

    -cqlTranslator.fulltextIndexField
     name of the fulltext index field.
     Used to determine if fulltext was searched and therefore fulltext has to get highlighted.

    -cqlTranslator.highlightTermFulltext
     name of the field containing the fulltext to highlight (field must be STORED and UN_TOKENIZED).

    -cqlTranslator.highlightTermFilename
     name of the field containing the name of the fulltext-file

    -cqlTranslator.highlightTermFulltextIterable (true or false, default is false)
     if more than one fulltext is indexed, you need one STORED,UN_TOKENIZED field containing the fulltext for each fulltext.
     if eg cqlTranslator.highlightTermFulltext is "fulltext" and cqlTranslator.highlightTermFulltextIterable is set to true,
     you need to have fields fulltext1 to fulltext<n> in your index, each containing text for one fulltext.
     if additionally cqlTranslator.highlightTermFilename is set to eg fulltext-file-name 
     and cqlTranslator.highlightTermFulltextIterable is set to true,
     you need to have fields fulltext-file-name1 to fulltext-file-name<n> in your index, each containing filename for one fulltext.
     If cqlTranslator.highlightTermFulltextIterable is set to false, you need to have 1 field with name defined in cqlTranslator.highlightTermFulltext
     containing the fulltext STORED, UN_TOKENIZED and if cqlTranslator.highlightTermFulltextIterable is set to false, one field with 
     name defined in cqlTranslator.highlightTermFilename, containing the filename of the fulltext.

    -cqlTranslator.highlightTermMetadata
     name of the field containing the metadata-text to highlight (field must be STORED and UN_TOKENIZED).

    
    
-Configuration-changes require a restart of the JBoss-Application-Server



Run the fedoragsearch.war and srw.war on a different server (in the following called search-server):
-both fedoragsearch.war and srw.war must run on the same search-server
-copy the directory containing the configuration below the search-servers config-directory
-make sure that config-directory of search-server is in classpath
 (Tomcat: edit catalina.properties in conf-dir of Tomcat:
  add ${catalina.home}/conf to property common.loader)
-on the search-server, you can remove the index.object-types.properties-files in the index directories
-on the core-framework server you have to keep the search-config-directory-structure and the index.object-types.properties-files,
 you can remove the rest.
-you have to have a file named escidoc-core.properties in the config-directory of the search-server.
 The escidoc-core.properties must contain the following properties:
    -search.properties.directory (relative to the config directory of the search-server)
    -escidoc-core.selfurl (base-url of the escidoc-core framework)
    -gsearch.fedoraPass persistent handle of an system-inspector for access from fedoragsearch to eSciDoc-core framework.
 The escidoc-core.properties may contain:
    -escidoc-core.proxyHost
    -escidoc-core.proxyPort
    -escidoc-core.nonProxyHosts
-Adapt property fedoragsearch.soapBase in fedoragsearch.properties to search-server.
-Adapt property gsearch.url in escidoc-core.custom.properties on core-framework server
