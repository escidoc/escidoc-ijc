		The eSciDoc Core Java Client Library (short: client-lib) shall
		smooth the way for Java programmer to implement application on top of
		the eSciDoc infrastructure.  
	</para>

	<para>Each version of the eSciDoc Infrastructure Java Client Library
		supports a specific version of the eSciDoc infrastructure. The
		supported version of the infrastructure is shown within the package
		name.
	</para>
	<para> This version of the client lib supports only eSciDoc
		infrastructures of the version 1.2 series. The compatibility with
		update
		versions of the 1.2 series should be given. 
	</para>

	<para>This client lib is not compatible with eSciDoc infrastructure
		version 1.0 or 1.1.
	</para>

	<para>
		The infrastructure delivers XML representation to support
		programming language independent client applications.
		Programming with
		Java means usually to work with classes. This lib could hide all
		required steps to map between XML representation and class mapping.
		But if one does not need mapping he can still work in XML and
		snippets
		of XML and is still supported with method stubs to send requests to
		the
		infrastructure.  
	</para>

	<para>The client lib contains only little logic and does therefore give
		only little support to compile required values. Parameter and data
		structure checking is done by the infrastructure to avoid a
		duplication of logic. Nevertheless, makes it a pojo easy to explore
		settable values.
