* fixed struct-map binding for Container: the finding failed with an unordered
  list of members
* fix MemberList: MemberList is not longer derived from genericResource, 
  because it isn't, and has now limit, offset, and numberOfResults as 
  attributes
* add UserAccountAttributes

15.07.2010 - SWA
* Change StructMap in a way that only references for Container and Item could
  be set as member. The StructMap itself is now, consistent to other resources,
  from derieved type LinkedList. This breaks the interface, because not 
  ResourceRef but MemberRef is now to set.   
* fix description handling in Container
* Preferences is derived from LinkedList

28.06.2010 - SWA
